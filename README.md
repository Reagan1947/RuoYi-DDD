## 1.1 Introduction
### 1.1.1 Summary
RuoYi is a framework that has been well practiced in admin backend development, 
but as development has progressed, problems such as code bloat and increased 
complexity of loops have become apparent. We hope to optimize the problems caused 
by traditional MVC framework through the design concept of DDD, and give RuoYi
a chance to practice this framework.
